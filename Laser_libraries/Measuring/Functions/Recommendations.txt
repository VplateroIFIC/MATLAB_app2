These are all the measuring functions we used during laser tests.

I would recommend to start the measuring function for measuring one sensor from scratch, 
and store the points in a scattered format, this is in a Nx3 matrix (S) 
which stores the X,Y and Z positions of all points, being S(i,j) the coordinate j 
(1=x,2=y,3=z) of the ith point.
