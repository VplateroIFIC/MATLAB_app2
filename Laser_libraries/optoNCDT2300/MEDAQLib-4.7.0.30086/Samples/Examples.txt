  - Open, get some information, get some data blocks, close.
  
IF2008:
  - C command line program using MEDAQLib.lib for linking MEDAQLib.dll at program start.
  - Create and opens several ILD2300 over IF2008 and an encoder channel.
  - Get sensor information, parametrize encoder.
  - Poll data, synchronize channels, Transfer data.
  - Close and release sensors.

DLLExample:
  - C command line program dynamically loading MEDAQLib.dll after program start.
  - Create sensor instance for ILD2300 using IF2008/ETH interface.

LabView
  - Contains VI's for calling all MEDAQLib functions using LabView's Call Library Function Node
  - Interface-Ethernet.vi shows how to connect with Ethernet sensors
  - Interface-IF2004_USB.vi shows how to connect a sensor via IF2004_USB
  - Interface-RS232.vi shows how to connect a sensor via RS232 or RS422 (USB converter)
  - All these samples connect to sensor and get data from one sensor channel
