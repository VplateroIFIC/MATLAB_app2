function angle = CalibrationRotationCamera(gantry, cam, fid, direction, Nimages, gap)
%UNTITLED2 This function calculat the angle of the offset camera-gantry
%   A set of images of the fiducial are taken. the calculated centers are fitted into a line, and the angle with the orizontal axis is calculated
% The F fiducial has to be seen during all the movements. The inicial position is important.
% A focused image is required to the proper identification of the fiducial. Focus before run the function.
% inputs
%   gantry: gantry object
%   camera: camera object
%   fid: fiducials object
%   direction: 0 for X direction, 1 for Y direction
%   Nimages: Number of images taken
%   gap: separation between images
% outputs
%   angle: angle offset camera-gantry.
